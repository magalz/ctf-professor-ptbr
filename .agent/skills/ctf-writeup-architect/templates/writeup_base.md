---

## 1. Executive Summary
*Provide a 2-3 sentence overview of the challenge and the core vulnerability exploited.*

## 2. Reconnaissance & Triage
*Document the initial analysis phase.*
* **Initial Assumptions:** What did the artifact/scenario look like initially?
* **Tools Used:** (e.g., `file`, `strings`, `nmap`)
* **Key Findings:** What specific output pointed toward the vulnerability?

## 3. Vulnerability Analysis (The Theory)
*Explain the root cause of the flaw.*
* **Mechanism:** How does the vulnerable system process data?
* **The Flaw:** Where exactly does the logic fail? (Include relevant code snippets if reverse engineered).

## 4. Exploitation (The Execution)
*Step-by-step reproduction of the attack.*
1. **Preparation:** Setting up the environment or payload.
2. **Execution:** The specific command or script used (include the `exploit.py` code or terminal commands).
3. **Result:** How the system responded and the flag acquisition.

## 5. Real-World Impact & Mitigation
*Bridge the gap between the CTF and enterprise security.*
* **Enterprise Scenario:** Where would this vulnerability typically be found in a corporate network?
* **Remediation:** How to fix it.
  * *Code level:* (e.g., Input sanitization, safe functions).
  * *Infrastructure level:* (e.g., WAF rules, network segmentation, dropping privileges).
