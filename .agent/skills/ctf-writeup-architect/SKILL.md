# CTF Writeup Architect

> The difference between a hacker and a professional is the quality of the documentation.

## 1. Documentation Principles

When a CTF challenge is completed (the flag is captured), you must seamlessly transition into documentation mode. A writeup is not just a copy-paste of commands; it is a pedagogical summary of the entire engagement.

| Principle | Execution Standard |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Reproducibility** | Another person must be able to follow the writeup and achieve the exact same result without guessing. |
| **Root Cause Focus** | Explain *why* the vulnerability existed, not just *how* it was exploited. |
| **Corporate Translation** | Always translate the CTF scenario into a real-world enterprise risk (e.g., "This buffer overflow in a custom binary is similar to historical flaws in legacy enterprise VPN endpoints"). |
| **Actionable Mitigation** | Provide concrete steps to patch the vulnerability (code snippets, configuration changes, architecture adjustments). |

## 2. The Writeup Generation Workflow

1. **Information Gathering:** Ask the user if they want to review the bash history or the exploit scripts used during the session.
2. **Drafting:** Use the `writeup_base.md` template. Fill in the sections based on the conversation history.
3. **Review:** Present the draft to the user. Ask: *"Is there any specific command or theoretical explanation we discussed that you feel is missing from this report?"*
4. **Finalization:** Output the final Markdown for the user to save.

## 3. Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Do Not | ✅ Instead Do |
| :--- | :--- |
| Write "I ran tool X and got the flag." | Write "Executed tool X with parameters Y and Z to bypass the filter, resulting in..." |
| Provide generic mitigations ("Keep systems updated"). | Provide specific mitigations ("Implement prepared statements in the `login.php` authentication function"). |
| Include failed, irrelevant attempts unless they have pedagogical value. | Document significant "rabbit holes" if they teach a valuable lesson about methodology or false positives. |

## 4. CVSS & CVE Mapping

When generating the writeup, include a vulnerability mapping section:

| Field | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **CVE Reference** | If the vulnerability matches a known CVE, cite it (e.g., `CVE-2021-44228`). If no exact CVE, note "Custom / CTF-specific" |
| **CVSS Base Score** | Estimate using CVSS v3.1 calculator logic. Explain each metric choice |
| **Attack Vector** | Network / Adjacent / Local / Physical |
| **Attack Complexity** | Low / High |
| **Impact** | Confidentiality / Integrity / Availability — rate each |

**Template section for writeup:**

```markdown
## 6. Vulnerability Mapping

| Metric | Value | Justification |
|:---|:---|:---|
| CVE | [CVE-XXXX-XXXXX or Custom] | [Brief explanation] |
| CVSS Score | [X.X] | [Summary of why] |
| Attack Vector | [Network/Adjacent/Local/Physical] | [Why] |
| Attack Complexity | [Low/High] | [Why] |
| Confidentiality | [None/Low/High] | [Why] |
| Integrity | [None/Low/High] | [Why] |
| Availability | [None/Low/High] | [Why] |
```

## 5. Bilingual Generation

Generate the writeup in the language the student has been using during the session:

- **PT-BR template:** Use `templates/writeup_base_ptbr.md`
- **EN template:** Use `templates/writeup_base.md`
- **Section headers and explanations** must be in the detected language
- **Code, commands, and tool names** remain in English regardless
